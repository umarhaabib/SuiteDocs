= 12. Logic Hooks

== Intro

Logic hooks allow you to hook into various events in SuiteCRM to fire
custom code. This can allow you to, for example, make a call to an
external API, or to create a new record if certain events occur.

== Types

Logic hooks can occur in three contexts. These contexts are Application
Hooks, Module Hooks and User Hooks. These are detailed below.

== Application Hooks

Application hooks are hooks which are fired in the application context
(that is, they are not fired against a particular module). These hooks
must be defined in the top level logic hook (i.e.
`custom/modules/logic_hooks.php`).

`after_user_load`::
  Called after SuiteCRM has loaded the user, this is slightly different from 
  `after_login` in the user hook as this is fired for each request unlike
  `after_login` which is only fired when performing the login
`after_entry_point`::
  Called after SuiteCRM has initialised but before any other processing
  is carried out.
`after_ui_footer`::
  Called after the UI footer.
`after_ui_frame`::
  Fired after the UI has been displayed but before the footer has been
  displayed.
`server_round_trip`::
  Fired at the end of every page request.

== User Hooks

User hooks are fired for certain login/logout actions. Similar to
Application Hooks, these hooks must be defined in the top level logic
hook (i.e. custom/modules/logic_hooks.php).

`after_login`::
  Fired after a user logs in to SuiteCRM .
`after_logout`::
  Fired when a user logs out of SuiteCRM.
`before_logout`::
  Fired before a user logs out of SuiteCRM.
`login_failed`::
  Fired when a user attempts to login to SuiteCRM but the login fails.

== Module Hooks

Module Hooks are called on various record actions for a specific module.

`after_delete`::
  Fired when a record is deleted.
`after_relationship_add`::
  Fired after a relationship is added between two records. Note that
  this may be called twice, once for each side of the relationship.
`after_relationship_delete`::
  Fired after a relationship between two records is deleted.
`after_restore`::
  Fired after a record is undeleted.
`after_retrieve`::
  Fired after a record is retrieved from the DB.
`after_save`::
  Fired after a record is saved. Note that due to some peculiarities
  some related modules may not be persisted to the database. The logic
  hook is fired within the SugarBean classes save method. Some
  implementing classes may save related beans after this method returns.
  A notable example of this is the saving of email addresses in Company
  modules.
`before_delete`::
  Fired before a record is deleted.
`before_relationship_add`::
  Fired before a relationship is added between two records. Note that
  this may be called twice, once for each side of the relationship.
`before_relationship_delete`::
  Fired before a relationship between two records is deleted. Note that
  this may be called twice, once for each side of the relationship.
`before_restore`::
  Fired before a record is undeleted.
`before_save`::
  Fired before a record is saved.
`handle_exception`::
  Fired when an exception occurs in a record.
`process_record`::
  Fired when a record is processed ready to be displayed in list views
  or dashlets.

== Job Queue Hooks

Job queue hooks are fired for scheduler jobs. Similar to application
hooks these hooks must be defined in the top level logic hook (i.e.
`custom/modules/logic_hooks.php`).

`job_failure`::
  Fired when a scheduled job either returns false to signify failure or
  throws an exception and it will not be retried. See the section on
  link:../scheduled-tasks/[Scheduled Tasks].
`job_failure_retry`::
  Fired when a scheduled job either returns false to signify failure or
  throws an exception but it will be retried. See the section on
  link:../scheduled-tasks/[Scheduled Tasks].

== Implementing

Depending on the Logic Hook type logic hooks are either placed into +
`custom/modules/Logic_Hooks.php` or
`custom/modules/<TargetModule>/Logic_Hooks.php`.

=== Logic_Hooks.php

The logic hook file itself specifies which logic hooks to fire on this
event. It looks something like this:

                               'deleteRelationship');
----

Let’s go through each part of the file.

[source,php]
4 $hook_version = 1;


This sets the hook version that we are using. Currently there is only
one version so this line is unused.

[source,php]
5 $hook_array = Array();


Here we set up an empty array for our Logic Hooks. This should always be
called `$hook_array`.

[source,php]
7 $hook_array['before_save'] = Array();


Here we are going to be adding some before_save hooks so we add an empty
array for that key.

[source,php]
----
$hook_array['before_save'][] = Array(
                              77,
                              'updateGeocodeInfo',
                              'custom/modules/Cases/CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook.php',
                              'CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook',
                              'updateGeocodeInfo');
----


Finally we reach an interesting line. This adds a new logic hook to the
before_save hooks. This array contains 5 entries which define this hook.
These are:

==== Sort order
The first argument (77) is the sort order for this hook. The logic hook
array is sorted by this value. If you wish for a hook to fire earlier
you should use a lower number. If you wish for a hook to be fired later
you should use a higher number. The numbers themselves are arbitrary.

==== Hook label
The second argument (‘updateGeocodeInfo’) is simply a label for the
logic hook. This should be something short but descriptive.

==== Hook file
The third argument is where the actual class for this hook is. In this
case it is in a file called
`custom/modules/Cases/CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook.php`. Generally you will
want the files to be somewhere in custom and it is usual to have them in
`custom/modules/<TheModule>/<SomeDescriptiveName>.php` or
`custom/modules/<SomeDescriptiveName>.php` for Logic Hooks not targeting
a specific module. However the files can be placed anywhere.

==== Hook class
The fourth argument is the class name for the Logic Hook class. In this
case `CasesJjwg_MapsLogicHook`. It is usual for the class name to match the
file name but this is not required.

==== Hook method
The fifth, and final, argument is the method that will be called on the
class. In this case `updateGeocodeInfo`.

==== Adding your own logic hooks
When adding logic hooks you should make full use of the Extensions
framework (see the section on Extensions). This involves creating a file
in `custom/Extension/application/Ext/LogicHooks/` for application hooks
and `custom/Extension/modules/<TheModule>/Ext/LogicHooks/` for module
specific hooks. These files can then add to/alter the `$hook_array` as
appropriate.

After
adding a new logic hook it is necessary to perform a quick repair and
rebuild in the admin menu for this to be picked up.

=== Logic Hook function

The logic hook function itself will vary slightly based on the logic
hook type. For module hooks it will appear similar to:

.Example 12.2: Example logic hook method 
[source,php]
----
     class SomeClass
     {
         function someMethod($bean, $event, $arguments)
         {
           //Custom Logic
         }
     }
----



Application logic hooks omit the $bean argument:

.Example 12.3: Example logic hook method for application hooks
[source,php]
----
     class SomeClass
     {
         function someMethod($event, $arguments)
         {
           //Custom Logic
         }
     }
----




$bean (`SugarBean`) ::
The $bean argument passed to your logic hook is usually the bean that
the logic hook is being performed on. For User Logic Hooks this will be
the current User object. For module logic hooks (such as `before_save`)
this will be the record that is being saved. For job queue logic hooks
this will be the SchedulersJob bean. Note that for Application Logic
Hook this argument is not present.

$event (`string`) ::
The $event argument contains the logic hook event e.g `process_record`,
`before_save`, +
`after_delete` etc.

$arguments (`array`) :
The $arguments argument contains any additional details of the logic
hook event. I.e. in the case of before_relationship_add this will
contain details of the related modules.

{{% notice tip %}}
If you are performing certain actions that may trigger another logic
hook (such as saving a bean) then you need to be aware that this will
trigger the logic hooks associated with that bean and action. This can
be troublesome if this causes a logic hook loop of saves causing further
saves. One way around this is to simply be careful of the hooks that you
may trigger. If doing so is unavoidable you can usually set an
appropriate flag on the bean and then check for that flag in subsequent
hooks.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
Most logic hooks will cause additional code which can degrade the users
experience. If you have long running code in the after_save the user
will need to wait for that code to run. This can be avoided by either
ensuring the code runs quickly or by using the Job Queue (See the section on
  link:../scheduled-tasks/[Scheduled Tasks] for more information).
