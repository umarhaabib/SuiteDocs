= 14. Extension Framework

== Introductions

The extension framework provides a means to modify various application
data inside SuiteCRM. For example it provides a way to add or modify
vardefs, scheduled tasks, language strings and more. 

The mechanism is slightly more complicated than merely copying a file to custom 
directory to override all its contents, but has advantages:

- you can override just a part of what you're modifying
- different people can override different parts, without conflicts. For example, 
you can add a field to a layout, and then an add-on adds another, and a second add-on changes
something else in the same layout. SuiteCRM will make sure all changes will be consolidated.

In general a folder is provided in `custom/Extension` (the exact path depends on the
extension). This folder is then scanned for files which will be
consolidated into a single `ext` file which SuiteCRM will then read and
use. In this way it is possible for developers to add a new file to
affect the behaviour of SuiteCRM rather than altering existing files.
This makes the changes more modular and allows the easy addition or
removal of changes. 

Additionally, because these files are all consolidated it means that there is 
no effect on performance of checking a (possibly large) number of files. 
This is only done when performing a repair and rebuild in the admin menu.

== Standard Extensions

== Forcing overrides

To make sure certain customisations take precedence, there is an additional mechanism using files starting with `_override`, 
for example:

`custom\Extension\modules\Accounts\Ext\Vardefs\_override_my_field_change.php`

When *Quick Repair & Rebuild* is run, all the extension files are consolidated in two groups:

- the 1st run gathers files not starting with `_override` 
- the 2nd run gathers files which start with `_override`

Since these files are loaded with a PHP *require*, the PHP in them is executed, and the overrides will be the last to run, 
so they will take effect regardless of what is done in the files read before.

== Custom Extensions

Interestingly the extension framework can be used to add new extensions.
This allows you to create customisations that are easily customised by
others (in a similar manner to, for example, how vardefs can be added -
see the chapter on link:../vardefs/[Vardefs]).

To create a custom extension you simply add a new file in +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Extensions`. 

This can be given a name of your choosing. Our example will use +
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Extensions/SportsList.php` and will
look like:

.Example 14.1: Adding an entry point entry
[source,php]
----
<?php
$extensions["sports_list"] =  array(
    "section" => "sports_list",
    "extdir" => "SportsList",
    "file" => 'sportslist.ext.php',
    "module" => "");
----

Now when a *Quick Repair and Rebuild* is run any files in `custom/Extension/application/Ext/SportsList/` will be consolidated
into `custom/application/Ext/SportsList/sportslist.ext.php`. 

On its own this file will not do anything but you are now able to write custom code that
checks the consolidated file rather than having to worry about searching for customisations.

== Composer Extensions

In order to add your own packages to Composer, you can define them in files named like this:

`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Composer/\*/*.json`

An example could be
`custom/Extension/application/Ext/Composer/MyProject/AddToComposer.json`

Run a `composer install --no-dev` after adding this, and then again after each time you upgrade SuiteCRM.

These Composer extensions are handled not by SuiteCRM directly, but rather by the Composer
